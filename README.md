# TealTube Collection - Youtube Annoyance Fixes

This is a collection of scripts I've compiled to fix stupid UI problems in YouTube.
Some I've edited myself, some I've just copied from the community. I use these on Safari and Firefox.
I have no commercial interest. Feel free to copy and use as you see fit.
