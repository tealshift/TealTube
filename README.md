# TealTube Collection - Youtube Annoyance Fixes

This is a collection of scripts I've compiled to fix stupid UI problems in YouTube.

Some I've edited myself, some I've just copied from the community. I use these on Safari and Firefox.

I have no commercial interest. Feel free to copy and use as you see fit.

## YouTube Keyboard Shortcuts
This fixes the problem where clicking the UI controls on a video like the volume slider and timeline bar forces the browser focus away from the actual video player breaking your keyboard shortcuts, especially the arrow keys. (WTF how did they allow this?)

## YouTube Default Channel Tab
This makes it so whenever you visit a channel page it selects the Videos tab instead of the Home tab. The Home tab is an annoying default because the VAST majority of the time I'm visiting a channel I'm trying to browse their VIDEOS. jeezless crust the Home tab sucks.
